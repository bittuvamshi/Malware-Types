What is malware?
->Malware is malicious software, is any program or file that is intentionally harmful to a computer

Types of Malware:

1)Viruses :–
-> A Virus is a malicious executable code attached to another executable file.
-> Ands also a type of malware that often take the form of a piece of code inserted in an application, program, or system and they’re deployed by victims themselves.

viruses can:        
1)Seize applications        
2)Send infected files to contact lists       
3)Steal data
4)Launch DDoS attacks   
5)Launch ransomware attacks

viruses real-world example:
ILOVEYOU virus in 2000:- This malware virus impacted millions of computers around the globe and was downloaded by clicking on an attachment called “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs” and from an email with the subject line “ILOVEYOU.”


2)Worms :–
-> Worms replicate themselves on the system, attaching themselves to different files and looking for pathways between computers, such as computer network that shares common file storage areas
-> worm silently goes to work and infects the machine or even entire networks without the user’s knowledge.

worm malware can:        
1)Delete or modify files        
2)Steal data        
3}Install backdoors for hackers         
4)Launch DDoS attacks        
5)Launch ransomware attacks        
6)Create botnets        
7)Infect many computers at once

Worm malware example:       
SQL Slammer in 2003: Regarded as one the fastest spreading worm malware ever, SQL Slammer exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft’s SQL Server software. The attack took all but 10 minutes and impacted thousands of servers.


3)Trojan horse :–
-> A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the appearance of a desired operation such as playing an online game
-> Trojan horse varies from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files.

Trojan can:         
1)Delete, modify, or steal data         
2)Spy on users        
3)Access networks        
4)Launch DDoS attacks        
5)Take remote control of device

Trojan malware example:      
ZeuS/Zbot in 2011: This banking Trojan leveraged keystroke logging to steal credentials and also account balances.


4)Ransomware:- 
-> Ransomware, as the name indicates, is a type of malware that comes with a ransom. It locks and encrypts a victim’s device or data and demands a ransom to restore access. 
-> Once installed, the malware might create a backdoor for hackers to gain access to a device and then begin encrypting the data on locking owners out of their devices entirely until they pay a ransom to regain ownership

 ransomware can:        
1)Hold devices hostage        
2)Make data inaccessible through encryption        
3)Result in financial loss

Ransomware example:      
WannaCry in 2017: This ransomware attack targeted thousands of computer systems around the world that were running Windows OS and spread itself within corporate networks globally. Victims were asked to pay ransom in Bitcoin to retrieve their data.


5)Bots or botnets:-
->Botnets are a type of malware that gain access to devices through a piece of malicious coding. In some cases, botnets directly hack devices, with cybercriminals even taking remote control of devices.

bots or botnets can: 

1)Launch DDoS attacks
2)Record activity, including keystrokes, webcam, and take screenshots
3)Send phishing emails from your device
4)Give hackers remote control of devices

Bots + botnets example:
Mirai in 2016: This botnet attack targeted Internet of Things devices and, from there, leveraged DDoS attacks. 


6)Adware:-
->malware that involves advertising. Also known as advertising-supported software, adware displays unwanted advertisements on your computer, sometimes in the form of pop-up ads, that track users’ browsing activity

adware can: 
1)Be an annoyance
2)Lure users to malicious sites
3)Install spyware
4)Share user data with third parties

Adware example
Fireball in 2017: This adware infected around 250 million devices by means of browser hijacking to track victims’ web activity.


7)Spyware:-
-> malware that infiltrates devices without the owner’s knowledge
->This is often for the purpose of spying on internet activity, tracking log in and password information, or collecting sensitive information that can be used for fraudulent purposes. 

spyware can:
1)Breach personal privacy  
2)Collects confidential data, including by logging keystrokes
3)Steal data  

Spyware example :       
DarkHotel in 2014: This keylogger spyware targeted government and business leaders using hotel Wi-Fi. 


8)Rootkits:-
->malware that grants cybercriminals remote control of victims’ devices, oftentimes without the victims’ knowledge. Since rootkits are designed to remain hidden, they can hijack or subvert security software, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time causing significant damage. 

rootkits can:
1)Take remote control of devices
2)Grant cybercriminals admin access to devices       
3)Spy on users activity

Rootkits example :
Zacinlo in 2012: This rootkit stayed stealthy until about 2017 when it was first detected, delivering adware and disabling antivirus software on primarily Windows devices.


9)Keyloggers:-
-> Keyloggers, also called system monitors, are used to track nearly everything a user does on their computer. This includes emails, opened WebPages, programs and keystrokes.
 
keyloggers examples:
In 2016, a major survey conducted by a US-based cybersecurity firm revealed that businesses from 18 countries were targeted as part of a coordinated campaign that used the Olympic Vision keylogger to obtain confidential business-related information. Distributed via fake emails allegedly sent by business associates, this software-based keylogger logged not only keystrokes but also clipboard images and texts, saved logins, and instant messaging chat histories.
